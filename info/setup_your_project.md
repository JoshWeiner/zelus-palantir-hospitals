# Setting up Your Project

Great! Now that you've familiarized yourself with key concepts of Foundry, including how to upload data, create Foundry datasets, use pipelines, develop an ontology, and ultimately creating a user-facing workflow, here's a few specific steps you'll need to get started on our project:
1. Create a new project (*you can name it anything you want - and Viewer as the default role is fine*)
2. It's generally best practice to add folders to this new project to organize your files - try adding a folder for *data*, *pipelines*, and *applications* (using *+New -> Folder*)
3. Within your data folder, hit the green *+New* button and choose to *Upload Files*
4. Select the unzipped .csv files you've downloaded that we have provided you to use in the project
5. When uploading, use the default *Structured Data* option


You now have data in foundry you can use to create objects on top of - great! Ontologizing this data will follow a very similar process to the one with which you are already familiar with from the [Get Familiar with AIPNow](/info/aip_now_help.md) section in the homepage.

Again, try your best to resolve issues on your own, but reach out to the following with blockers:
