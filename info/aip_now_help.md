# Getting Started

After creating your account and logging in, you should now be on the AIPNow homepage. This demo stack comes with a few pre-built pieces to help you get started, as well as guided, hands-on tutorials that will help you go from 0 to 1. 

To make sure you're in the right place, your URL while on this page should look like: 

```<YOUR_AIP_NOW_URL>.<PROVIDER_REGION>.palantirfoundry.com/workspace/aip/```

At the bottom of the page, you'll see a few [training](https://learn.palantir.com/) videos, the first of which is [Speedrun: Your First End-to-End Workflow](https://learn.palantir.com/speedrun-your-first-e2e-workflow).

We recommend you start here before trying to approach the project head-on, since using Foundry for the first time can be a little overwhelming. This first video should be enough to get you started, but there's also some other helpful resources:
1. [Building your First Pipeline](https://learn.palantir.com/deep-dive-building-your-first-pipeline)
2. [Creating your First Ontology](https://learn.palantir.com/deep-dive-creating-your-first-ontology)
3. [Building your First Application](https://learn.palantir.com/deep-dive-building-your-first-application)

The above concepts are critical pieces of Foundry that everyone on the Hospitals team - echos and deltas alike - interact with on a daily basis. Most Palantirians learn these on the fly (just like you!).

If you're having trouble figuring something out, do your best to struggle through it or reference Palantir documentation. If you need, feel free to reach out to the following for more direction:
