# Build Now – Palantir for Hospitals Recruiting Competition
Palantir technology powers mission-critical, real-world decisions across industries, helping operators to prevent wildfires, distribute vaccines, staff nurses, improve road safety, and more. Build the future with us. Now. 

Our customers come to us with a hunch that the only way to improve their hospital operations, provide the best care, structure effective healthcare policies, or deliver healthcare to more patients is to make better use of their data. The Palantir for Hospitals team is responsible for turning that hunch into reality.

- Use NLP to extract medication names and dosages from patient notes and correlate them with ICD-10 codes to identify potential unsafe drug interactions or contraindications.
